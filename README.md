# MotoEvents | Final project for Ironhack Bootcamp

## SPA created with Express, Node, MongoDB and React

MotoEvents is a website for finding, joining and creating events related to motorbikes.

It allows you to register for adding friends, compare your motorbikes with other users using dinamic graph visualization (Nivo Rocks) and finding events with a search bar. 
Accesing event details you can check the joined users, comment the event and get the location with Google Maps.
